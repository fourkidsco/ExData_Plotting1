## Introduction

David Early Project 1 Exploring Data Coursera

## Changing parameters

At the beginning of each program, you can set the datafile location/name and 
the output file location/name.

By default each is set to the local directory.  If needed, copy the data file
to the local directory OR change the location/name for "datafile" in each
program.
